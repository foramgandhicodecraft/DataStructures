Introduction:
This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of fundamental data structures. Each data structure is implemented in multiple languages, making it easier to understand different approaches and language-specific nuances.

Implemented Data Structures:
Currently, the repository includes implementations of the following data structures:
Linked List
Stack
Queue
Binary Search Tree
Heap
Hash Table
Graph (adjacency list representation)
Each data structure is organized into its own directory with implementations in various programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, and more.

Usage:
To use any of the implementations, navigate to the respective directory and choose your preferred programming language. Each directory contains detailed comments and instructions within the code files themselves.

Contributing:
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute your own implementations, improvements, or additional data structures, please follow these steps:
Fork the repository.
Create your feature branch (git checkout -b feature/YourFeature).
Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some feature').
Push to the branch (git push origin feature/YourFeature).
Open a pull request.
Please ensure your code follows the existing style and includes appropriate documentation/comments.
